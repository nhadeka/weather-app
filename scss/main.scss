// 7-1 sass pattern(folder architecture). (7 folders, 1 file) 
// 7 folders- abstracts(mixins,variables...), base(global styles...), components, layout, themes, pages, vendors(3rd-party lib).
//in 7-1 sass pattern, 1 file- main.scss(like an entry point where you import all other partials and compile them into a single css file )
// this app is single page and we don't use 3rd-party library so we use 5-1 folder pattern.
